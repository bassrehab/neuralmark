# Enhanced AlphaPunch: Advanced Robust Image Fingerprinting Algorithm

Enhanced AlphaPunch is an advanced version of the original AlphaPunch algorithm, incorporating cutting-edge techniques for more secure and robust image fingerprinting. This version combines multiple advanced approaches to create a unique and highly resilient fingerprinting method.

## Features

- Quantum-inspired embedding for enhanced security
- Adaptive fractal-based fingerprint generation
- Multi-scale wavelet domain embedding
- Blockchain-inspired chaining for tamper evidence
- Adversarial training for improved robustness against AI-based attacks
- Homomorphic encryption integration for secure verification
- All features from the original AlphaPunch (DCT-based embedding, error correction, etc.)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- Pillow
- scipy
- pycryptodome
- tqdm
- opencv-python
- scikit-image
- PyWavelets
- tensorflow
- phe (Python Homomorphic Encryption library)
- requests

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhanced-alphapunch.git
   cd enhanced-alphapunch
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Embedding a Fingerprint

```python
from enhanced_algorithm import EnhancedAlphaPunch

alphapunch = EnhancedAlphaPunch(private_key="your_secret_key_here")
fingerprint, psnr, ssim = alphapunch.embed_fingerprint_with_quality("input_image.jpg", "fingerprinted_image.png")
print(f"PSNR: {psnr:.2f} dB, SSIM: {ssim:.4f}")
```

### Verifying a Fingerprint

```python
is_authentic, similarity = alphapunch.verify_fingerprint("fingerprinted_image.png", fingerprint)
print(f"Image is {'authentic' if is_authentic else 'not authentic'}")
print(f"Similarity: {similarity:.2%}")
```

### Running Tests with Unsplash Images

1. Get an Unsplash API key from https://unsplash.com/developers
2. Replace `YOUR_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` in `enhanced_unsplash_tester.py` with your API key
3. Run the tester:
   ```
   python enhanced_unsplash_tester.py --num_images 20
   ```

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Quantum-Inspired Embedding**: Simulates quantum superposition in the embedding process for enhanced security.
2. **Adaptive Fractal-Based Fingerprint**: Generates fingerprints based on the fractal dimensions of image regions.
3. **Multi-Scale Wavelet Embedding**: Distributes the fingerprint across multiple frequency bands for improved robustness.
4. **Blockchain-Inspired Chaining**: Creates a tamper-evident structure within the image itself.
5. **Adversarial Training**: Improves resilience against AI-based forgery attempts.
6. **Homomorphic Encryption**: Allows for fingerprint verification without decryption, enhancing security in untrusted environments.

## Performance Considerations

Due to the advanced techniques used, the Enhanced AlphaPunch algorithm may require more computational resources and processing time compared to the original version. It's recommended to run this on a machine with good CPU/GPU capabilities, especially when processing a large number of images.
